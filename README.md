## Basic bot initialization on Discord

This is a basic code to start a bot on Discord. To do this, only a very basic command is being used. As I experiment more with the topic, more topics will be added and this file modified.


    
## Initialize

1째 : Clone the project

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/iBlasterx/botDiscord_py.git
```


2째: You will need to install all required modules in requirements.txt.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
    
3째 : File .env creation required and enter the KEY of your bot. You can find the key inside the [Discord dev portal.](https://discord.com/developers/applications)

```python
DISCORD_TOKEN = Enter KEY
```
4째 : Debug bot.py file.
